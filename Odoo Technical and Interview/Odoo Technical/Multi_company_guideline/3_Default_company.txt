Default company

	When the field company_id is made required on a model, a good practice is to set a default company.
	It eases the setup flow for the user or even guarantees its validity when the company is hidden from the view.
	Indeed, the company is usually hidden if the user does not have access to multiple companies (i.e. when the user does not have the 	group base.group_multi_company).
	
	
	from odoo import api, fields, models

	class Record(models.Model):
	    _name = 'record.restricted'
	    _check_company_auto = True

	    company_id = fields.Many2one(
		'res.company', required=True, default=lambda self: self.env.company
	    )
	    other_record_id = fields.Many2one('other.record', check_company=True)


	View:-
		<field name="company_id" groups="base.group_multi_company"/>
