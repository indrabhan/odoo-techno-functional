Security rules

	When working with records shared across companies or restricted to a single company, we must take care that a user does not have 		access to records belonging to other companies.

	This is achieved with security rules based on company_ids, which contains the current companies of the user (the companies the user 	 checked in the multi-company widget).
	
	
	<!-- Shareable Records -->
	
	<record model="ir.rule" id="record_shared_company_rule">
	    <field name="name">Shared Record: multi-company</field>
	    <field name="model_id" ref="model_record_shared"/>
	    <field name="global" eval="True"/>
	    <field name="domain_force">
		['|', ('company_id', '=', False), ('company_id', 'in', company_ids)]
	    </field>
	</record>
	
	
	<!-- Company-restricted Records -->
	<record model="ir.rule" id="record_restricted_company_rule">
	    <field name="name">Restricted Record: multi-company</field>
	    <field name="model_id" ref="model_record_restricted"/>
	    <field name="global" eval="True"/>
	    <field name="domain_force">
		[('company_id', 'in', company_ids)]
	    </field>
	</record>
