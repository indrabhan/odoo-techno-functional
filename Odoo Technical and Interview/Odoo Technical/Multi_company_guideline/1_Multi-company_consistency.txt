Multi-company consistency

	When a record is made shareable between several companies by the mean of a company_id field.
	we must take care that it cannot be linked to the record of another company through a relational field. 
	For instance, we do not want to have a sales order and its invoice belonging to different companies.
	
To ensure this multi-company consistency, you must:

	Set the class attribute "_check_company_auto" to True.
	Define relational fields with the attribute "check_company" set to True if their model has a company_id field.

On each create() and write(), automatic checks will be triggered to ensure the multi-company consistency of the record.

	from odoo import fields, models

	class Record(models.Model):
	    _name = 'record.shareable'
	    _check_company_auto = True

	    company_id = fields.Many2one('res.company')
	    other_record_id = fields.Many2one('other.record', check_company=True)
	    
	    
	Note

	The field company_id must not be defined with check_company=True.
