Install Maintenance App

Effective Date:-
	In the Equipement you define the effective date (date from the machine will be in used)
	

Preventive Maintenance Frequency:-
	Set the number of days so that after that many days machine will have its maintenance check.

Next Preventive Maintenance:-
	Once you save the machine the Next Preventive Maintenance date will be auto calculated based on effective days
	Note:- In the initial case,  it will be calculated based on the effective date.
	
Maintenance duration: Duration of maintenance in hours.


Expected mean time between failures: 
	user set the value
	One can set the expected mean time between failures in days.
	This is nothing but average mean time between failures.


Mean time between failures(MTBF): 
	value is in days. It is readonly field. Autofield
	It is calculated based on the corrective failure. 
	Suppose an equipment failure happens on 06/04/2019(6th April 2019), and next failure happens on 10/04/2019(10th April 2019), mean
	time between failures will be 4 days. 
	However, the first failure is calculated based on the effective date.
	means I thing the difference between the corrective failure and effective date.
	

Estimated Next Failure:-
	Date field and it is readonly, Autofield.
	Latest Failure + MTBF
	In the case of the first failure of the equipment, it is calculated based on the effective date.
	
Latest failure: Last failure date will be updated automatically.


Mean time to repair(MTTR):
	value is in days. It is readonly field. Autofield
	Mean time between maintenance and repair in days. 
	If the maintenance started on 2nd May 2019 and equipment got repaired on 3rd May 2019. In that case, the mean time to repair will  	be 1 day.
