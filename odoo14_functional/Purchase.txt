If you are using Manufacturing route you will need a BoM on the product. If the product is not 			fully configured or there is a mistake in your routes, a next activity will be logged on the product informing you there 			is an issue with the configuration(In Chatter).
		
	Note:- you can create more then 1 reordering rule for loaction wise.
		If the rule is trigger then it will always keep the max qty in stock and accordingly manage the qty in RFQ.
		
	Question.)I have created a reordering rule with a minimum stock of 5 units and a maximum of 10 units. When the reordering rule is 		triggered, how many units will it order?
	
		1.)As much as needed so you have a minimum of 5 units in stock
		2.)It will always order between 5 and 10 units
		3.)As much as needed so you have 10 units in stock		(Correct)
		4.)It will always order 10 units
