Account:
		
	DOUBLE ENTRY BOOK-KEEPING SYSTEM	
				
		1.)Adding a value to an account is Debit, always shown on Left side
	
						Debit		Credit		Balance

	RECONCILIATION
		Reconciliation is the process of Mapping or linking two journal entries to make a clear that they balance each other.
		If two journal items on same account but with two different Journals (suppose you invoiced the customer, so one JV is 			created and the cutomer pays you via Bank so another JV is created)
		Reconciling the enteries with each other makes the invoices as paid and this process is know as reconciled.
	
		Journal			Account			Debit		Credit
		
		Customer Invoice		Account Receivable				100
		Bank				Account Receivable		100
	
	

	Note:-
		when you validate the customer invoice of Rs 100 then the entry goes in Debit column of Account Receivable.
		When you actually recieve the money from customer then the enteries are created in Credit column of Account Receivable 			and Debit column of Bank account(received through bank).

		For Vendor bill 1st entry will be in credit(means the amount you have to give)

Journals:-
	Journals are the book keeping where you will record similar type of transactions
